# **F**ile **Op**erations**s**

This Vim plugin provides several file-related commands. Copy, move, rename,
delete, and find files directly from the Vim command window. Plus, keep your
current buffer updated. Did you just rename the file you're currently editing?
No worries; FOPS can update your buffer to edit the renamed version.

TODO - mention that this plugin uses `argonaut.vim`.
